To start this project you should run it in IDEA and use command "yarn start" in tree/app folder. 
Also you need to create database in MySQL. For this reason there is a file folders_folder.sql in tree folder. It is a backup file of needed database.
Or you can just create your own database with name folders. Create table folder in it with columns id, title, parent_id.
Node with id 1 will be the root. Then you just add other nodes and use the application.
